## Installation

You can build the theme file by running `make`. This will create the `tenebris.obt` file that can be installed from the `ObConf` application or manually editing the configuration files.

You can also download the .obt file from the [latest release](https://github.com/shaggyz/openbox-tenebris/releases/latest).
